[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) has revolutionized the way developers style their web applications, offering utility-first classes that make styling both efficient and expressive. One of its most powerful extensions is the [**Typography plugin**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin), which provides a set of `prose` classes designed to style rich text content beautifully and responsively.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to leverage Tailwind's typography utilities to create stunning blog content that is both readable and visually appealing, especially in [dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) environments.

## Setting Up Tailwind Typography

To get started, ensure you have the Typography plugin installed and configured in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,mdx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};
```
